# Introduction

The World Happiness Report, an annual survey launched in 2012 the former UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, and world-renowned economist and professor, Jeffrey Sachs, the (Sustainable Development Solutions Network) SDSN promotes integrated approaches to implement the SD Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, through education, research, policy analysis, and global cooperation, transcends traditional metrics of national progress by evaluating global happiness. assessing life satisfaction through the Cantril ladder ( a poll of countrymen rating theand examines six critical factorsâ€”economy, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and governance. These factors benchmark against 'Dystopia', a hypothetical least-happy state, to highlight each country's relative performance.

Our exploration probes the nuances of these factors, unveiling shifts in happiness rankings and identifying trends that inform policy-making for improved societal well-being. As we navigate through the data, we unravel the complexities of happiness, understanding it as a multifaceted human experience that extends beyond what can be captured in numbers alone.

## Data Overview
We'll be using correlation graphing and scatter plots density and bar graphs to exemplify weighting by factors to potentiate citizen's satisfaction in life.

The "glimpse" of the dataset offers a quick look at its structure and the types of data it contains for our analysis. Essential variables within the dataset include the ladder happiness score of each country, as well as factors such as GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy, freedoms, generosity, and perceptions of government corruption. These factors are believed to have an impact on the happiness score.

## Top 5 Countries


```{r}
top5 <- data2019 %>%
  arrange(desc(Score)) %>%
  select(Country.or.region, Score, Overall.rank) %>%
  head(5)

top5
```

## Bottom 5 Countries

```{r}
bottom5 <- data2019 %>%
  arrange(Score) %>%
  select(Country.or.region, Score, Overall.rank) %>%
  head(5)

bottom5
```



## Histogram of Happiness Scores

A histogram displays a distribution of happiness scores across countries. The shape and spread of this distribution can give us an initial understanding of global happiness levels and variance.

```{r}
hist(data2019$Score, main="Histogram of Happiness Scores", xlab="Happiness Score", col="blue", border="black")

```



The histogram of happiness scores suggests a symmetric distribution, with a roughly equal number of countries reporting happiness scores above and below the mean score of approximately 5.41. This balance indicates that global happiness levels are fairly evenly distributed across the dataset, with no significant skew toward higher or lower scores. The central tendency is around the mid-range of the scale, which points to a moderate level of happiness reported by most countries.


##Social Support vs. Happiness Score

```{r}

ggplot(data2019, aes(x=Social.support, y=Score)) +
  geom_point(colour="blue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Social Support vs Happiness Score") +
  xlab("Social Support") +
  ylab("Happiness Score")

```

This visualization examines the impact of social support on happiness scores across different regions.

# Scatter Plots with Facets
## GDP per Capita vs. Happiness Score

```{r}
ggplot(data2019, aes(x=GDP.per.capita, y=Score)) +
  geom_point(colour="red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("GDP per Capita vs Happiness Score") +
  xlab("GDP per Capita") +
  ylab("Happiness Score")

```
This scatter plot reveals how GDP per capita relates to happiness scores across different countries. A positive trend would suggest that higher economic output per person is associated with increased happiness.

## Conclusion

Through this analysis, we have uncovered significant insights from the 2019 World Happiness Report. The top 5 happiest countries showcase exemplary scores in factors like GDP, social support, and healthy life expectancy. The faceted scatter plots reveal how these relationships vary across different regions, suggesting that the determinants of happiness might be influenced by cultural, economic, or geographical factors. The global map further emphasizes the geographical spread of happiness, indicating regions where policy interventions could be most beneficial. Overall, this report highlights the complex interplay of various factors contributing to national happiness.
